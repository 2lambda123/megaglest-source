# How it currently works?
# Set version here (only here) and just start build on linux. Versions will be
# updated everywhere automatically, but if CurrentGameVersion is a "dev" then
# only game version will be automatically updated (saving time during rebuild
# and for cleaner "git status").
#
# Then you should on the occasion commit changed files (this step should/will
# disappear someday, during later improvements).

CurrentGameVersion = "3.12-dev";
# ^ typical version numbers look like this: "3.11-beta1.0", "3.12-dev", "3.12.0"

OldReleaseGameBinaryVersion = "3.11.0";
OldReleaseGameDataVersion = "3.11.0";
LastCompatibleSaveGameVersion = "3.9.0";

MapeditorVersion = "1.6.1";
G3dviewerVersion = "1.3.6";

GitCommitForRelease = "4446.1a8673f";
# ^ will be automatically generated
